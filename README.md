## Quick Start

This root package serves as the **quick-start entry point** for the Akgentic framework, providing complete examples that demonstrate the full capabilities of multi-agent team coordination.

### Installation

Akgentic is on PyPI. To install the whole framework:

```bash
pip install "akgentic-framework[all]"
```

Add the optional backends and heavier tool extras (Mongo persistence, vector
search, document parsing, …):

```bash
pip install "akgentic-framework[all-extras]"
```

`akgentic-framework` is a meta-distribution: it contains no code of its own,
only a pinned set of requirements, so an extra installs the exact subpackage
versions that were built and tested together for that release.

#### À la carte

Extras compose, and each one pins its **whole** akgentic dependency closure at
the versions of this release — so `[agent]` fixes `akgentic-llm` and
`akgentic-tool` too, rather than letting them resolve to whatever is newest.

| Extra | Installs |
|---|---|
| `core` | `akgentic-core` |
| `llm` | `akgentic-llm` |
| `tool` | `akgentic-tool` + `akgentic-core` |
| `agent` | `akgentic-agent` + `akgentic-llm`, `akgentic-tool`, `akgentic-core` |
| `team` | `akgentic-team` + `akgentic-core` |
| `catalog` | `akgentic-catalog` + `akgentic-team`, `akgentic-tool`, `akgentic-core` |
| `infra` | `akgentic-infra` + the whole set |
| `postgres` | `akgentic-catalog[postgres]`, `akgentic-team[postgres]` + their closure |

```bash
pip install "akgentic-framework[agent,catalog]"
```

`mongo` and `postgres` are mutually exclusive persistence backends, so
`[all-extras]` ships the Mongo flavour. Compose the other one explicitly:

```bash
pip install "akgentic-framework[all,postgres]"
```

The base install is the actor framework alone (`akgentic.core`), so it stays a
usable minimal floor:

```bash
pip install akgentic-framework
```

Subpackages can also be installed directly — `pip install akgentic-agent` —
which is the right choice when you depend on one part and do not want a
release-wide pin.

#### Running from a clone

Cloning this repository and syncing installs the release set from PyPI — no
submodules needed. This is what you want to try the examples below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/b12consulting/akgentic-framework.git
cd akgentic-framework
uv sync
source .venv/bin/activate
```

`uv sync` installs every subpackage with its optional extras, so the demos run
immediately. (Published metadata stays lean: `pip install akgentic-framework`
still gets `akgentic.core` alone. The full set comes from a uv dependency group,
which pip ignores.)

#### Working on the sources

To change subpackage code rather than just use it, switch the same checkout into
source mode. **Initialise the submodules first** — uv reports a confusing error
if a workspace member directory is missing:

```bash
# 1. Fetch the sources, pinned at the release tags this version pins
git submodule update --init

# 2. Uncomment the two blocks under "SOURCE MODE" in pyproject.toml

# 3. Re-sync; akgentic-* now resolve to the local sources, editable
uv sync
```

The submodules are pinned at the exact commits their release tags point to, so
what you get is the code this release was built from — `uv run python
scripts/verify_submodules.py` checks it. Because every package's own CI resolves
its dependencies from PyPI, this is the only place unreleased cross-package
changes are exercised together.

Two things to expect:

- `uv.lock` is rewritten when you switch modes. That diff is expected; don't
  commit it — `git checkout uv.lock` when you're done.
- The `==` pins still apply to the local sources. Bump a submodule's version and
  `uv sync` fails until you regenerate the pins with `scripts/sync_versions.py`.
  That's deliberate: the pin table *is* the declared release set.

To check how the published metadata resolves without re-commenting anything, use
`uv sync --no-sources`.

### Running the Server and Frontend

After installation, open two terminals to launch the backend and the web UI:

**Terminal 1 — Start the backend server:**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate

# Set your API keys (get them from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys and https://app.tavily.com/)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"
export TAVILY_API_KEY="your-tavily-api-key"

# Launch the server (param --logfire enables structured logging, https://logfire-eu.pydantic.dev/)
python src/infra_server.py
```

**Terminal 2 — Start the web UI:**

The frontend is an Angular app published from its own repository, and it is not
part of the Python install — fetch its sources before the first run:

```bash
git submodule update --init packages/akgentic-frontend
cd packages/akgentic-frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Once both are running:

- **Web UI** — [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) — create and interact with agent teams visually
- **API docs** — [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) — interactive OpenAPI (Swagger) interface to explore and test all REST endpoints

By default, the server stores team catalogs in `./data/catalog/` and the event store in `./data/event_store/`. These paths are configurable via the `CommunitySettings` class or environment variables prefixed with `AKGENTIC_`.

### Command line Agent Team Example

The [src/agent_team/main.py](src/agent_team/main.py) example demonstrates a complete multi-agent team system from a simple python script without the full infrastructure.

**What it demonstrates:**

- Building a team with Manager, Assistant, and Expert roles using `AgentCard`
- Interactive chat loop with `@mention` routing (e.g., `@Expert help me`)
- `HumanProxy` for human-to-agent communication
- `EventSubscriber` for real-time message flow visibility
- Dynamic team composition (Manager can hire Assistant/Expert on demand)
- Slash commands: `/team`, `/roles`, `/planning`, `/hire <role>`, `/fire <name>`

**Team Structure:**

- **Manager**: Coordinates team, can hire Assistant and Expert roles
- **Assistant**: Provides support and research
- **Expert**: Provides specialized knowledge
- **HumanProxy**: Routes human input to Manager

**Key Concepts:**

- `AgentCard` — Defines agent roles with skills, prompts, and `routes_to` restrictions
- `BaseAgent` — LLM-powered agent with typed `AgentMessage` protocol
- `register_agent_profiles()` — Registers `AgentCard` catalog with orchestrator
- `EventSubscriber.on_message()` — Event-driven message monitoring
- `HumanProxy.send()` — Sends `AgentMessage` from human to agents
- `cmd_get_team_roster()` — Retrieves current team roster programmatically

**Run the example:**

```bash
# Set your OpenAI and TAVILY API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key" # https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
export TAVILY_API_KEY="your-tavily-api-key" # https://app.tavily.com/

# Activate the environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run the team example
python src/agent_team/main.py
```

**Interactive Features:**

In this example, as a human user, we instruct the manager to ask the expert (`@Expert`) about his role in the team. The manager routes an `AgentMessage(request)` to the expert, who replies with `AgentMessage(response)`. The manager then relays the answer back to the human.

By default messages are addressed to the Manager, but you can route them to specific agents using `@AgentName` prefix — e.g., `@Expert what is your role?` sends directly to the Expert. Use `/help` to see all available slash commands.

```
Team members:
  - @Human (Human)
  - @Manager (Manager)
  - @Assistant (Assistant)
  - @Expert (Expert)

Type your message (start the message with @{agent_name} to route to specific agent, 'exit' to quit or '/help' for help):
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ask @Expert what is his role in the team

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[@Manager] -> AgentMessage(request) [@Expert]:
You received a request from @Manager:

Could you please describe your role and main responsibilities within the team?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[@Manager] -> AgentMessage(response) [@Human]:
I'll reach out to @Expert to clarify his role in the team.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[@Expert] -> AgentMessage(response) [@Manager]:
You received a response from @Expert:

Certainly, @Manager. As the Expert within the team, my primary role is to provide deep, specialized knowledge and technical guidance. My responsibilities include:

1. Offering in-depth analysis and solutions for complex problems...

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[@Manager] -> AgentMessage(response) [@Human]:
@Human, here is @Expert's response regarding his role:

As the Expert, his primary role is to provide deep, specialized knowledge and technical guidance. His responsibilities include:

1. Offering in-depth analysis and solutions for complex problems...


exit

Exiting chat loop.
```

This example showcases the **akgentic-agent** package capabilities. For LLM-driven agent patterns and the typed message protocol, see [the akgentic-agent README](https://github.com/b12consulting/akgentic-agent/blob/master/README.md).

### Catalog-Driven Agent Team Example

The [src/catalog/main.py](src/catalog/main.py) example builds the same multi-agent team, but every definition — prompt templates, tools, agents, and team structure — comes from YAML files in `src/catalog/` loaded via the **akgentic-catalog** package.

Instead of defining `AgentCard` objects in Python, you declare them in YAML catalogs and resolve them at runtime through `TemplateCatalog`, `ToolCatalog`, `AgentCatalog`, and `TeamCatalog`. This enables configuration-driven team composition without code changes.

```bash
python src/catalog/main.py
```

See [the akgentic-catalog README](https://github.com/b12consulting/akgentic-catalog/blob/master/README.md) for catalog documentation.

## Architecture

Each package lives in its own repository and publishes itself to PyPI. This
repository is the entry point: it pins a coherent set of them and, in source
mode, mounts them as submodules under `packages/`.

```
packages/                 (submodules — empty until `git submodule update --init`)
  akgentic-core/        → Zero-dependency actor framework (Pykka, messaging, orchestrator)
  akgentic-llm/         → LLM integration layer (pydantic-ai, multi-provider, REACT pattern)
  akgentic-tool/        → Tool abstractions (ToolCard, ToolFactory, workspace, planning, search, KG, MCP)
  akgentic-agent/       → Collaborative agent patterns (BaseAgent, typed message protocol, HumanProxy)
  akgentic-catalog/     → Configuration registry (YAML-driven CRUD catalogs)
  akgentic-team/        → Team lifecycle management (create/resume/stop/delete, event sourcing)
  akgentic-infra/       → Infrastructure backend (three-tier: community, department, enterprise)
  akgentic-frontend/    → Angular web UI (REST + WebSocket client for akgentic-infra)
```

**Dependency graph** (lower layers have no upward dependencies):

```
akgentic-frontend ──depends on──>  akgentic-infra (REST + WebSocket API)
akgentic-infra    ──depends on──>  akgentic-core + akgentic-llm + akgentic-tool + akgentic-agent + akgentic-catalog + akgentic-team
akgentic-catalog  ──depends on──>  akgentic-core + akgentic-llm + akgentic-tool + akgentic-team
akgentic-team     ──depends on──>  akgentic-core (only)
akgentic-agent    ──depends on──>  akgentic-core + akgentic-llm + akgentic-tool
akgentic-tool     ──depends on──>  akgentic-core + (pydantic, pydantic-ai, tavily-python, httpx)
akgentic-llm      ──depends on──>  (pydantic-ai, httpx, tenacity)
akgentic-core     ──depends on──>  (pydantic, pykka)  ← zero infrastructure deps
```

## 🛠️ Development

### Where the work happens

Each package is its own repository, with its own CI, lint rules and coverage
gate. Changes to a package are made, reviewed and released **there** — this
repository holds no subpackage code.

What it does hold is the release set, and the one place unreleased packages are
exercised together. Every package's CI resolves its dependencies from PyPI, so
no package's own pipeline ever sees an unreleased sibling. Source mode here is
where that combination gets tried:

```bash
git submodule update --init
# uncomment the two blocks under "SOURCE MODE" in pyproject.toml
uv sync
```

Each submodule is a normal checkout of its repository, so branch and commit in
it as usual — and open the PR against that repository, not this one. The
submodules are pinned at release tags, so you start from exactly the code this
release was built from:

```bash
uv run python scripts/verify_submodules.py
```

Run a package's own tests and checks from its directory, under its own
configuration:

```bash
cd packages/akgentic-core
uv run pytest tests/
uv run mypy src/
uv run ruff check src/
```

This repository's own gates cover `scripts/` and `src/` only — it has no test
suite, and deliberately does not collect the submodules'.

### Cutting a release

The umbrella's version is a release-set counter: it is bumped by hand when a set
of package versions is worth publishing together. The pins are not — they are
generated from the submodules.

```bash
# 1. Move the submodules to the release tags you want in the set
git submodule update --init
git -C packages/akgentic-core checkout v1.6.0

# 2. Regenerate the pins and extras from those submodules
uv run python scripts/sync_versions.py

# 3. Bump [project].version by hand, then open a PR with both changes
```

Once merged, and once every package version in the set is on PyPI, dispatch
**Release** (tags the commit, attaches the umbrella wheel and sdist to a GitHub
Release) and then **Publish to PyPI** from the Actions tab. Both refuse to run
if a pinned version is missing from the index, if a submodule is not sitting on
its release tag, or if the committed pins disagree with the submodules.

The PyPI project page shows the description of the *latest* release, baked into
that release's metadata. It cannot be edited in place — a README fix reaches
PyPI only on the next version bump.

## Design Principles

1. **Zero infrastructure dependencies** in core
2. **80% minimum test coverage** (enforced)
3. **Comprehensive type hints** (mypy strict mode)
4. **Modular packages** (use what you need)
5. **10-minute time-to-first-agent** target

## Testing Standards

All packages maintain:

- ✅ 80%+ test coverage
- ✅ mypy strict mode compliance
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests
- ✅ Integration tests for cross-package features
